# Different k-s k=1 k=10
Use a sequence of meshes that for low values of h is good for all values of k

# Fixed overlap

For the theory to work. Make a note about possible additional gains when using only a single h-strip. Plot the real work, taking into account the decreased number of DoFs.

# Less trivial example geometrically
# Dir
# Neu
# Multiply connected
